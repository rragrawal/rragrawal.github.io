Welcome to my webpage! I'm working as a Marie-Curie researcher at the [Centre for Digital Music](https://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) in [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/). My current work with [Professor Simon Dixon](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~simond/) involves improving Audio-to-Score alignment using Machine Learning techniques. Prior to this, I was working as a researcher at the [Machine Translation](https://ict.fbk.eu/units/hlt-mt/) group at [FBK, Italy](https://www.fbk.eu/en/). My research interests include **Machine Learning for Audio Signal Processing**, **Contextual AI** and **Natural Language Processing**. To know more about my professional background, please see [Education and Work Experience](/testWeb/background). Selected publications are listed [here](/testWeb/publications).

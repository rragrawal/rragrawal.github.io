Welcome to my webpage! I'm working as a Marie-Curie Researcher at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/), specializing in Artificial Intelligence. My current work with [Professor Simon Dixon](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~simond/) involves Deep Learning for Signal Processing and Multimodal Sequence Alignment using Machine Learning techniques. Prior to this, I was working as a Researcher at the [Machine Translation](https://ict.fbk.eu/units/hlt-mt/) group at [FBK, Italy](https://www.fbk.eu/en/). My broad research interests include **Multimodal Deep Learning**, **Adaptive and Contextual AI**, **Natural Language Processing** and **Clinical Machine Learning**. Selected publications are listed [here](/publications) and updates are listed [here](/news). To know more about my professional background, please see [Education and Work Experience](/background).

Welcome to my website! I'm working as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) within the [Computational Health Informatics Lab](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/chi/), specializing in Artificial Intelligence for Healthcare. Prior to this, I was working as a Marie-Curie Researcher at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/) in the [MIP-Frontiers](https://mip-frontiers.eu/) project, and before that as an AI Researcher at the [Machine Translation](https://ict.fbk.eu/units/hlt-mt/) group at [FBK, Italy](https://www.fbk.eu/en/). My broad research interests include **Multimodal Deep Learning**, **Adaptive and Contextual AI**, **Natural Language Processing** and **Clinical Machine Learning**.

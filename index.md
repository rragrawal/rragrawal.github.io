Welcome to my website! I work as a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/). I work on Artificial Intelligence for Healthcare at the [Computational Health Informatics Lab](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/chi/). Prior to this, I was working as a Marie-Curie Researcher in the [MIP-Frontiers](https://mip-frontiers.eu/) project, hosted at the [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/), and before that as an AI Researcher at the [Machine Translation](https://ict.fbk.eu/units/hlt-mt/) group at [FBK, Italy](https://www.fbk.eu/en/). My broad research interests include **Multimodal Deep Learning**, **Adaptive and Contextual AI**, **Natural Language Processing** and **Clinical Machine Learning**.
